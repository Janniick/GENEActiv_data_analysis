# GENEActiv_data_analysis

The main goal of this code is to make the Analysis of GENEActiv raw data (.bin files) more userfriendly using a GUI. 
For the first part of the analysis, I've used the open source code called GGIR and adjusted it to my needs.
You can find detailed information about GGIR on their website: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GGIR/vignettes/GGIR.html
The second part of the code was written by myself and tries to gather and display interesting data about the persons day- and especially their nighttime activity.

I added many comments throughout the code to make it more understandable.
